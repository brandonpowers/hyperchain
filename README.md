Play in the traditional 2D mode - much faster and smoother than the original - or in 3D. 
The 3D mode is the same game from a different perspective.

There is also a third mode which attempts to emulate a CRT television straight from the 80s. 
This mode uses an orthographic camera, limits rotations to the Z axis for a purely 2D experience,
adds a glow layer and a layer of scanlines.

This project was built over a few weeks in Javascript using the BabylonJS framework. ViteJS is used as a build tool.

The repository includes all code, blender models and images. Have fun and use them as you like.
